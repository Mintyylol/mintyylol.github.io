i did absolutely nothing on this lol
all of the coding was done by [PixelMan572](https://github.com/PixelMan572)
all i did was go through the images and rename them all üëç

i hope you enjoy the website as much as i do c:


P.S. we stole a lot of the code from [raccoons.pictures](https://raccoons.pictures), and theres some code from that website still in the code. thanks for the code
