Fun websites. From Live Raccoon Cameras, to Random Bunny Images.  
*The main website was coded by me (I'm sure you can tell). Most of everything else was done by [PixelMan572](https://github.com/PixelMan572). He's the reason this entire thing exists.*  



# Random Bunnies
A collection of almost 400 bunny images, randomly chosen on each page load.  
I do not know where the images came from, but I know they're all from Twitter.  
*Entirely coded by [PixelMan572](https://github.com/PixelMan572), Image Curation by me.*  

# RacCam
A live feed taken from the [Raccoon Saloon](https://www.youtube.com/@RaccoonSaloon) YouTube channel.  
This constantly breaks, as the streams sometimes go down. This is also very CPU intensive - Laptops are not recommended.  
*Most of the code is by [PixelMan572](https://github.com/PixelMan572), with some slight adjustments by me.*
