Fun websites. From Live Raccoon Cameras, to Random Bunny Images.



# Random Bunnies
A collection of almost 400 bunny images, randomly chosen on each page load.
*Entirely coded by [PixelMan572](https://github.com/PixelMan572), Image Curation by me.*

# RacCam
A live feed taken from the [Raccoon Saloon](https://www.youtube.com/@RaccoonSaloon) YouTube channel.
This constantly breaks, as the streams sometimes go down. This is also very CPU intensive - Laptops are not recommended.
*Most of the code is by [PixelMan572](https://github.com/PixelMan572), with some slight adjustments by me.*
